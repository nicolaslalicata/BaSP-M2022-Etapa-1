# Become a Software Professional by RADIUM ROCKET!
The problem raised this week was to layout the landing page of the application that we are building with HTML and with the corresponding sections and parent elements.

 **My way of resolution** was to divide the project into sections and give each section a class to organize my code and make it easy to read. At the same time, add .png or jpg for the aesthetic part of the landing page.
 
I found the markdown language very fun and super intuitive since we can make the README much more readable and understandable.
