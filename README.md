# Become a Software Professional by RADIUM ROCKET!
The problem presented this week was to layout the HTML landing page of Trackgenix application. In order to do so, we were asked to build the corresponding sections and parent elements.

 **To achieve the solution**, *my first step* was dividing the project into sections, and asign a class to each one. This allowed my to organize my code, and
make it easier to be read.
I also add some images, to start the esthetic part of the landing page.
 
I found this markdown language very fun and super intuitive since we can make the README much more readable and understandable.
